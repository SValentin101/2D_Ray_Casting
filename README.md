# 2D_Ray_Casting

In this proyect I have implemented a nice 2d Ray Casting algorithm with many different type of objects-obstacles. 
This objects (squares, rectangles, triangles & trapeziums) can be moved, spinned and resized at will with not issue in regards to the ray casting or performance.

The visual aspect (window, drawings, texts) was done using the SFML library.
